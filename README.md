# Information_Retrieval

This is the repository for information retrieval course projects.

In the first phase, we were supposed to:
- Preprocess the text (Normalization, Tokenization, Removing stop words, lemmatizing, stemming)
- Indexing (Bigrams)
- Compression (Variable Code, Gamma Code)
- Correcting the user input Query

The second phase consists of implementing the language model, editing the probability model, candidate generator, and candidate scorer.
In the third phase, we implemented classification and clustering algo- rithms, designed a crawler, and evaluated articles and ranked authors based on information collected by the crawler.
